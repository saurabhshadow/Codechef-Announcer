# Codechef-Announcer
A Python Script which will be responsible for notify announcement of the running contest.


You just need to replace contest link and run this python program on background.

Note : Program must run continuously until you want notification.

For ex : If the contest link is "https://www.codechef.com/COOK108A".
then variable contest_link must assigned with this link and must look like this

contest_link = "https://www.codechef.com/COOK108A"




Note : For other operating system there is a only need of change in message function because notify-send command will not work in windows.
